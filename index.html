            A <b>CITY</b> is a large human settlement.It can be defined as a permanent and densely settled place with
            administratively defined boundaries whose members work primarily on non-agricultural tasks.Cities
            generally have extensive systems for housing, transportation, sanitation, utilities, land use, production of
            goods, and communication. Their density facilitates interaction between people, government organisations and
            businesses, sometimes benefiting different parties in the process, such as improving efficiency of goods and
            service distribution.

            Historically, city-dwellers have been a small proportion of humanity overall, but following two centuries of
            unprecedented and rapid urbanization, more than half of the world population now lives in cities, which has
            had profound consequences for global sustainability. Present-day cities usually form the core of
            larger metropolitan areas and urban areasâ€”creating numerous commuters traveling towards city centres for
            employment, entertainment, and education. However, in a world of intensifying globalization, all cities are
            to varying degrees also connected globally beyond these regions. This increased influence means that cities
            also have significant influences on global issues, such as sustainable development, global warming, and
            global health. Because of these major influences on global issues, the international community has
            prioritized investment in sustainable cities through Sustainable Development Goal 11. Due to the efficiency
            of transportation and the smaller land consumption, dense cities hold the potential to have a smaller
            ecological footprint per inhabitant than more sparsely populated areas. Therefore, compact cities are
            often referred to as a crucial element of fighting climate change.However, this concentration can also
            have significant negative consequences, such as forming urban heat islands, concentrating pollution, and
            stressing water supplies and other resources.

            Other important traits of cities besides population include the capital status and relative continued
            occupation of the city. For example, country capitals such as Beijing, London, Mexico City, Moscow, Nairobi,
            New Delhi, Paris, Rome, Athens, Seoul, Singapore, Tokyo, and Washington, D.C. reflect the identity and apex
            of their respective nations.Some historic capitals, such as Kyoto and Xi'an, maintain their reflection
            of cultural identity even without modern capital status. Religious holy sites offer another example of
            capital status within a religion, Jerusalem, Mecca, Varanasi, Ayodhya, Haridwar and Allahabad each hold
            significance.
